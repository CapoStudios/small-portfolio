# small-portfolio 

## Description
This is a small portfolio made with [Vuejs](https://v3.vuejs.org/).
It has links to differents social media. It's responsive and very minimal. The code is avaible on [GitHub](https://github.com/CapoStudios/small-portfolio) and it's Open Source.
I Hope this little project helps new developers with Vue js.

And As always Happy Coding! 👨‍💻💪
